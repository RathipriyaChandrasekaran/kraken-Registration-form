The user can fill in the appropriate fields which are validated in the client-side and when the user clicks the 'submit'  button the server-side validations are done.
The database checks whether the EmailId is unique or not, If 'yes' a success dialog is displayed.

JQuery validation frameworks and bootstrap-css are being used in this example.
